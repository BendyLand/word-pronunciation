# Word Pronunciation Finder

*This project is currently non-functional.*

Quickly search for the basic pronunciation of an English word. You may choose to specify --ipa for to get the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) pronunciation instead.

## (Projected) Usage
```bash
pronounce word # Output: "w - urd"
pronounce word --ipa # Output: "/ wÉœrd /"
```
**Note:** 
 - This tool is meant to give you a complete pronunciation, broken into logical groupings of sounds. 
 - These groupings do **not** indicate syllable emphasis; they are simply meant to isolate individual sounds, which makes it easier to practice them. 
     - Syllabic grouping could be an interesting feature to add in the future.

## About

This is just a quick little tool I wanted to build for fun. I have a background in music, and while I wouldn't call myself *fluent* with IPA personally (I'm an instrumentalist), I understand enough of it to put this together; certainly more so than the typical programmer who *didn't* take several courses on choral methods in college (though probably less than the ones who built the music software I used in college ðŸ˜‰).
